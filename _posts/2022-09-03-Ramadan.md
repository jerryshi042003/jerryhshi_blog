Disclaimer: I talk in-depth about Ramadan and Muslim culture throughout this blog. As I am not Muslim, the experiences and opinions expressed are purely my own. I hope to share my thoughts in a thought-provoking and respectful manner. If anything I write concerns you please contact me from my About page. 



## Intro

In April of 2022, I decided to participate in the Muslim tradition of Ramadan. If you are unfamiliar, Ramadan is a month-long practice in which you abstain from both eating and drinking during the day from around 5am till 8pm—the time changes day by day. Every year, more than a billion Muslims celebrate it yearly. So what's unique about my Ramadan story?

I am not Muslim. I’m not even religious. I am a Asian-American male in college, who decided to partake in Ramadan without any religious attachments. Now you might have some questions. Why would I do this? Is this cultural appropriation? Was it worth it? All questions that I have asked myself many a time and been asked by my peers. However, it is because of my unique perspective that I can share what I have learned about Ramadan as an outsider, who was eager to learn and try something new.

When people ask me why I started Ramadan, I would love to respond that I did it to better understand the feeling of gratitude or that I wanted to educate myself on a rich cultural tradition. But if I am going to be honest, I had no such stoic intentions, at least at the beginning. I was eating dinner with a couple of my tennis friends when Suhail, my Muslim friend, jokingly asked us to participate in Ramadan during the coming month. And I accepted.

## Beginning of Ramadan

And so just like that I started Ramadan. Thankfully, UCLA was accommodating with their Ramadan options, allowing for food to be taken out and providing Halal options. The hard part came down to my physical and mental endurance. 

## First Day

The first day. I woke up early, around 4:30, to grab a few quick bites of a bagel before falling back asleep. Waking up again later, I walked to and from classes slowly getting thirstier. The sun harshly beamed on my neck and arms. The weight of my body felt lighter as water exited through sweat but my calves grew weaker as if I had depleted my energy source. I couldn’t sit still in my room anymore, so I did what I had to do to kill time and keep myself occupied. Play tennis. I called up all my friends to come to the courts, rotating between friends. The first 2-3 hours went by like that, but I still had time left for dinner. I was parched. My legs were tingling, barely able to hold up my weight. Yet I played through another hour and a half, counting the minutes till sundown. 

I checked the clock.

8:20 	8 minutes left. I can make it.  
8:25 	3 minutes left. I’m almost there. Went back to playing.  
8:27 	1 minute left. Time slowed down.  
8:27 	30 seconds left. I bit my teeth into my shirt, filled with excitement.  
8:27 	5 seconds left. My energy exploded and I started running with joy.  
8:28 	I made it.   

My friends accompanied me to a long-awaited dinner in which I devoured lamb gyros while chugging water and eating as much fruits with water to quench my thirst. I wrote in my journal that the honeydew felt like I had “found a stream of water after aimlessly walking around in the Sahara [Desert]”. I was so relieved to be able to freely eat, I sat there for two hours, filling my stomach beyond full. The problem now was getting myself to stop eating. 

## Day by Day Struggles

After that first day, this pattern continued more or less. I would wake up, do my daily activities, play a little too much tennis, and be exhausted by dinner. That last minute before dinner started always felt so slow. Sometimes I would get to a dining hall just a little early and patiently choose my meal and watch the clock on my phone, minute by minute until it was time for Iftar, the meal after sunset. However, the more I struggled, the more rewarding that meal felt. And I started to embrace the difficulty of fasting. 

As the month carried on, my ability to not think about food improved while my thirst never really went away. I would even take cold showers in an attempt to quell my thirst. But it was usually to no avail. 

I’m sure the negative effects of fasting are imaginable. Just imagine low energy, hangry, and water being the only thing on your mind. It definitely affected my mood even when I did not realize it. 

A couple of days during Ramadan I was playing a tennis tournament in Davis, and I got into an argument with the opposing team over them taking a break mid-point, and I had to take a step back, apologize, and acknowledge to myself that my anger was not directed at them but rather my thirst. It was kind of like that Snickers commercial: “You’re not you when you’re hungry”. That is most definitely a true statement.

During that same Davis tournament, because of our constant traveling from our Airbnb to the tournament site and to restaurants, I was forced to accompany my teammates to many dinners and lunches where I had to watch them feast while my tummy growled in hunger. Sometimes watching them chug down water was so unbearable that I had to take walks and naps to take my mind off food. There were also instances when—because of our timing during travels and restaurants closing early—my food for the day would consist of peanut butter and white bread found in passing gas stations.

That said, I bring this up not to dramatize my experience. But it occurred to me that if I’m struggling with completing Ramadan, think about the many other people who are also able to make time for Ramadan despite their daily lives. Growing more comfortable with fasting, I started to expand my thoughts beyond survival and see the silver lining in my struggles.

At Davis, Ramadan allowed me to gain comfort being independent while also strengthening my bond with the team. In the time my friends were eating lunch, I would be able to walk around the campus freely and discover the local farmers’ market. I remember clearly the cool wind on a hot day blowing on my chest as I ran around the town of Davis. The leaves rustled aboved me as I closed my eyes to take a nap on the grassy campus quad. But independence does not always mean loneliness. I began to feel more content, a feeling of solitude. And to make up time together, my teammates would wait to eat a late dinner so that I could be included. The usual tense environments of tournaments completely vanished as we ate our dinners in high spirits with laughter. I was so proud to be on that team. 

## Explaining Ramadan

There were many times that I needed to explain myself for doing Ramadan. 
It’d usually start off like:

“Can you get lunch?”  
“Nah”  
“Why not?”  
“I’m doing Ramadan”  
“Ok, cool… wait what?”
“Yeah”  
“Umm… can I ask why?”

Towards the beginning, I was very eager to answer “I’m doing Ramadan”. When you first tell that to someone there is a look of confusion then a little bit of awe. It made me feel special, for a moment. But, I quickly realized that such behavior was contradictory to the selfless nature of Ramadan. 

If you did not know, besides the fasting, Ramadan heavily focuses on introspection, charity, and family. At the beginning, I definitely got carried away in that excitement that was fasting day by day and made a point of it to my peers. It was either my thirst, hunger, or sore legs: there was always something to complain about. I took a long look in the mirror and I saw an embarrassing sight of someone using pity to get the attention of others. Especially since I understood the purpose of Ramadan focused on humility, I felt deeply embarrassed by my actions. After realizing this, I tried my best through the rest of the month to complain as little as possible no matter how thirsty or tired I was. And by silently enduring it day by day, I was able to feel humbled and proud of my behavior.

## Breathing Example

However, that did not make fasting any easier. There was one day that I had forgotten to drink water in the morning. My throat, mouth, and lips were dried up with many hours left in the day. I lacked focus to study anything. Showering only temporarily soothed my mind. And even napping could only kill a few hours. I lay there on my bed daydreaming about water gushing down my mouth, desperate to make the time go by.

But at that moment, I was reminded of the Buddhist ideology that desire only brings unhappiness and accepting is how you can move forward. I realized that I had been exposed to this same idea in countless art forms and books. From J.Cole’s song Love Yourz to Nadal’s autobiography detailing his match mentality and accepting whatever is thrown at you: soreness, rain, foot injuries, Nadal will play through it all. 

So instead of thinking about what I so obviously wished for: water. I thought about what I had in my life that other people might be wishing for in the same way I wanted water. At that moment, as I heaved long, slow dry breaths, I thought about my lungs. Young healthy lungs that supported my body with each unconscious breath. In that moment for the next couple of minutes I focused on each conscious breath and was filled with a sense of appreciation with each inhale and exhale. This intense yet peaceful feeling was something I had always heard about but never truly understood: gratitude. 

## Post Ramadan Reflections

Getting tired and thirsty were all things that I expected—but maybe not that degree of intensity. However, as I now look back and reflect on my whole experience in Ramadan, I see a couple of ways it affected me that I was not expecting. 

1. Subconscious Frustration
    
    Hungry leads to hangry which leads to arguments which leads to conflicts. Initially my thirst and hunger were obvious. I knew my body was not performing as it should be. But as the month continued, I started adapting to the conditions to the point where the pain wasn’t obvious, in fact it was barely noticeable. That is, until I started hitting my limits. 

I felt like I was brimming with energy, but in reality my physical conditions exhausted my mental capacity far beyond what I recognized: affecting my personality and focus. I would have trouble maintaining conversations and wanting to socialize much less. This confused me and I questioned why I could not enjoy the same things. 

On the tennis court, I could not maintain my focus, missing much more than normal and easily getting into arguments. One day I was trying my hardest to focus, playing one ball at a time, when my friend called a ball I thought was in: out. My energy had been building up through that point and when I heard the out, confusion rushed up my throat and vomited out in anger. My opponent’s partner looked at me in a way that asked “What is wrong with you?” My impatience and inability to control my emotions made me feel disgusted at myself. And this only stacked upon the existing frustration, creating a negative feedback loop.

It was only until I recognized that I was overwhelmed, despite not feeling low in energy, that I was able to resolve my problems. I started playing one or two games less than normal, giving my body and mind both time to rest. If I didn’t want to socialize I would apologize and explain that I needed time for myself. Even occasional blow-ups could be better resolved by taking a deep breath, acknowledging a slight lapse in judgment, and apologizing quickly.

What I came to realize from this is that frustration and exhaustion builds up even when you don’t feel it coming. After experiencing this first-hand, I try to extrapolate my feelings to better understand other peoples’ situations. I’ve come to understand that hardships can make you act differently than you normally would or want to. And with this realization, I wish to treat others with more patience and compassion especially if I don’t know the burdens they carry.
    
2. My Limit
    
    To be transparent, besides Ramadan, April was a stressful month and a lot of my personal insecurities grew larger than I could handle. Ramadan's physical and mental toll on me only exacerbated the situation. And during that month I had two of my first panic attacks. 

Similarly to my mental depletion of patience, my stress levels had unconsciously risen to unmanageable levels. My thoughts began to spiral into doubts and fears. I feared that my effort trying to improve at tennis had all gone to waste. I feared that ambiguity in career goals was a sign of future failure. I feared that I would lose the personal relationships of people I cared about. I was scared, confused, and ashamed to feel this way. 

On my birthday, in the middle of April, the same thing happened. I was in front of my friends, supposedly having a fun time, and I felt like walls were closing in on me. I didn’t want to be there, but I felt embarrassed to even feel that way and I started to wonder what was wrong with me. My breathing sped up unnaturally. I started to hyperventilate. I buried my face into my hands, trying to take slow deep breaths. I felt a desperate need to escape. When I looked up, my friends were sitting next to me: surrounding me and reassuring me. Without having to ask what happened, they instinctively showed me kindness and patiently waited.

One of my friends, usually the funniest and loudest one in the group, told me to grip her hand as hard as possible and yell at the top of my lungs that I love myself and everything would be ok. She wouldn’t take no for an answer, so I reluctantly followed her instructions and whether I believed myself or not, I felt a bit of relief and even slowly smiled. It was silly and stupid but it worked.

My goal with this anecdote is not to draw sympathy but rather showcase that Ramadan definitely takes a toll on one’s life and requires sacrifice. But having friends and family along the way to support you reminds you that you are loved and appreciated, making it that much easier. 

Ramadan has helped me acknowledge my stress limitations so that moving forward I can give myself room to breathe, especially in other stressful situations beyond Ramadan. Now if I find myself needing help, I know that I have people who will be there for me. That fact in itself is something I am so grateful for. 

Quick Comment: On my birthday because of my unstable condition, I took that day off Ramadan to rest. I completed an extra day at the end of the month to make up for it. 
    
    
3. Other People’s Reactions and How it Affected Me
    
    Most people heard my explanation for doing Ramadan and supported me fully. But a couple of friends could not see my perspective at all. In fact they almost seemed more confused after my explanation. One of my friends saw no point in “hurting yourself” and suggested that I stop immediately. Another friend silently winced while I was explaining my motivation and it was clear that she was troubled by my actions. These reactions hurt me deeply and crushed my resolve. Although I still felt purposeful in my actions, I detested the thought that in the eyes of my friends I was doing something wrong: I felt guilty.

It took me a while, but I slowly came to understand that regardless of how they showed it, all of my friends were first and foremost concerned about my health. I had confused some of their caring worries as invalidating my actions. Now knowing that, I had no issue patiently taking time to explain my motivations, hear any of their concerns, and share the positive experiences and things I had learned. 

That being said, I do understand how it may sound weird for me, a foreigner to Muslim culture, to participate in Ramadan. I hope that my friends can understand my perspective in wanting to learn about fascinating age-old tradition and especially its emphasis on reflection and self-restraint—two qualities that I wish to improve on. But regardless of what they think, I came to acknowledge the growth in myself that I was able to witness and I am proud of the journey and sacrifice I endured. 

One conversation I distinctly remember is with a friend who had one Muslim and one Catholic parent. Growing up, he was acquainted with Ramadan and after listening to my reasoning, he greatly supported my endeavors. Similarly, in college he had his fair share of exploration, experimenting with Buddhism and learning about its ideology regardless of its religious attachments. Through this process, he was able to find some of his own core values and incorporate such practices as becoming vegetarian into his lifestyle. What he emphasized, however, was that it was not the actual act of trying to become vegetarian that allowed him to grow, but rather the open-mindedness to explore new ways of thinking foreign cultures by experiencing them first-hand. I was so glad that I was able to have this conversation with someone who finally understood my point of view and it inspired and motivated me to finish the month strong. 

Even the friends who didn’t necessarily understand, yet remained supportive, were an immense help for me. In particular, I had two friends that were always checking in on me and patiently listening to all of my sources of distress. They made sure I knew that my wellbeing came first and that they would assist me in whatever way possible. On a whim they would come run the stairs at LATC with me or jump in the sunken fountain to get bruintized. How could you not feel full of energy when you have friends that are as crazy and weird as you are? So thank you Suhail and Solia! To paraphrase Ms. Rihanna, you were my umbrellas during the rain, and when we shine we shine together. 

## Ending Notes

What should you take away from this? I am by no means advocating for you to do Ramadan if you have no intention of doing so. As you can see from my experience, it is definitely not a walk-in-the-park and requires dedication, deliberation, and sacrifice. But that being said, I hope you take opportunities to try something new: knowing that with time and experiences, self-improvement or whatever answer you seek will come to unveil itself. 

There is a saying that I am quite fond of. 

“Pressure doesn’t build character, it reveals it.” 

And with this truth, I believe that the fearlessness and curiosity to undergo such pressure is essential to discovering who you are.
  
  
  
  
  
  
## tldr
If I had to sum my experience down to three things it would be 

* A new experience or different perspective can help you better understand gratitude amongst other emotions

* Don’t be afraid to try and commit to something out of the ordinary

* Never be afraid to ask for help and show love to those that respond

BONUS: “You ain’t you when you're hungry."
