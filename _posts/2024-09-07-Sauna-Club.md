*a short story about my love for the sauna*

In an unfrequented corner of my school gym’s locker room exists a mysterious, dorm-sized room. Often mistaken for the nearby janitorial supply closet, the room is covered by dark tinted windows, forcing you to squint to peep inside. Inside the room, however, is the opposite. The locker room lights penetrate the glass, allowing you to comfortably observe every curious passerby as you sit on the polished red spruce benches and listen to the mechanical hum of the metal heater in the corner. This is the UCLA Sauna, a room cherished by some but largely kept unknown.

A bald short man sits in the corner, headphones wrapped around his head. I catch a glimpse of the song he’s listening to from his phone. The entire title is unclear to me, but I do recognize two words: “Habibi Funk”. His legs are wrapped in a towel, revealing a chiseled upper body that naturally frames the three ink words displayed on his ribcage. In the opposite corner, a tall slender man takes deep breaths while tapping his neon running shoes on the floor. He keeps checking his Apple Watch, and I suspect it has something to do with the black square monitor strapped on the middle of his chest. Sitting next to me is an Asian man with glasses and ungroomed facial hair. I’m surprised to see how dry his fingers are as he flips through a wrinkled paperback book. His knees are tucked to support his reading position, exposing his bony ribs, lacking any extraneous fat or muscle.

I was no stranger to the sauna. Prior to college, my local gym had a sauna, which I would frequent often with my best friend. Under the heat, we would talk about our families, college applications, and highschool dating. It was like therapy to me. Every now and then, I would bring a speaker and we would sing and twerk alongside Fifth Harmony, disconnected and free from the world. 

I had never talked to a stranger in the sauna before. Without my highschool buddy, I now sat quietly between these three men. Focusing on my breathing, I waited for time to pass. Thoughts bubbled, ready to burst out my mouth as questions: What did the words on his ribs mean? What type of races did he run? Was he a professor or a really old student? 

My mouth was frozen in hesitation. I had spent many days in the sauna, silently wondering these questions, lacking the courage to meet someone new.

But today, curiosity finally broke through like a stream of water carving its path into a mountain. I introduced myself to these three men, one at a time, politely giving them a gentle tap before taking their new attention. 

They responded politely to my questions, and now that a path existed, their questions poured out to me as well. They were curious to know about my background and studies, offering more of their own stories in response.

The buff guy was a 26 year old professional bodybuilder, just starting his undergraduate after taking gap years to sober from a highschool cocaine addiction. The runner was a neuroscience Ph.D. candidate who was sauning to recover from a 100 mile ultra marathon, completed the weekend before (he had walked to the sauna with a cane). The man sitting next to me was a oceanography researcher from Vietnam, currently reading Camus and recently obsessing over the “Absurdist Movement”. 

The runner inquired about the oceanographer’s research and all of us were enlightened on a brief seminar of El Niño and heating cycles of Pacific waters near Peru. The body builder shared that he also coached the student powerlifting club at UCLA, and all of us eagerly listened to his strict diet and training program.  

From that day onwards, I began unabashedly asking questions and inviting conversation to everyone I met in the sauna. I figured, if they already had the determination to uncomfortably drip in sweat for 20 some minutes, a couple of pestering questions would still be in their tolerable range. But from their reactions, they seemed eager to volunteer their stories and interview me just the same.

Some stories were happy, some were full of struggles. I met Ukrainian refugees, many of whom had Russian family members with whom they could now barely communicate. A Japanese student explained to me that Western film had no budget in Japan where animation dominated, thus he came to Los Angeles with the dream of becoming a film director. I met a chef who shared his Bourdain-esque upbringing, starting as a dishwasher to line cook, having to work many restaurants and fill many roles before becoming the director of UCLA Dining.

We shared our upbringings and then our struggles and then our ambitions. Sometimes I learned a lot without the need for any words at all. I would bring my speaker and tap my phone on my neighbor’s shoulder, inviting a song recommendation. I was taught the difference between the many types of House music in Barcelona, I learned dances to traditional Guadalajaran Mariachi, and I was led in meditation chants by a buddhist from the Tibetan Mountains. In this small wooden box, I was transported around the world. If the mood was right, I would share the important lessons I had learned from Brasilian Funk and begin twerking freely once again. I laugh now, reminiscing on how I used to go to the sauna to hide from the world, and now I go to engage with it.

Frequent Sauna-goers asked me to start a club, so they could know when I went to the sauna. My “Sauna Club” Groupme had 80 people join overnight. The plan was to foster the same intimate conversations that had been occurring and create a networking sandbox for students to meet people of all backgrounds. But like all life, the club evolved to survive by reproducing and mutating by any means necessary. Fraternity boys invited their friends and so did other club athletes to create a party. I remember the look on the innocent man in the sauna as 15 club swim athletes entered, blasting Fred Again, and he promptly decided to leave.

I didn’t mind this crazy atmosphere, but it had overtaken and stepped on the intimate conversational environment that I cherished. It took me some maturity, but I came to accept that Sauna Club was something I no longer wanted. Some people cherished natural conversation, others wanted to party, and you can’t satisfy everyone. 

I had to relinquish control to realize that I still had everything I wanted. I stopped being the organizer, and I attended the sauna solitarily in the early mornings. It was peaceful. Club Sauna on the other hand, slowly withered to a halt without proper leadership, like a headless snake: the parties were over.

From then on, I frequented the Sauna alone: without expectation and with an open-mind. I could peacefully hear new stories and make new friends, and if I happened to run into an acquaintance, it was a delightful surprise that we got to enjoy the Sauna together. There is no need to plan and worry about something that works so well on its own.

Looking back, the sauna was my education, where I learned the essential human skill to listen and tell stories in order to collectively share accrued wisdom. These stories of various cultures, careers, and unique human struggles still stick with me and deepen both my understanding and interest of the world.

I strive for this depth in everything I do: including networking and cold calling. Instead of creating one loose thread between where someone has a job and where I want employment, I dig into their past work, their passions, and I ask them to tell me about their journey. When I travel I ask people to teach me the culture and traditions of their homeland, listening tentatively as if we are in the sauna together. When I’m frustrated out of confusion in a math lecture, I stand in front of the 100 other students and calmly ask the professor clarifying questions as if we are both in the sauna and I’m asking him to repeat his story.

The Sauna was my primordial soup, a goldilocks environment for me to rapidly grow, feeding off the mutually enriching knowledge of many lives. It reinforced my personality to always treat people and approach new situations with enthusiasm and respect.

I know that not everyone is willing and able to tolerate the heat such that the sauna is for you. But your passion, no matter how niche it is, has a community somewhere waiting for you to find it. Mine was in the unsuspecting back corner of the Wooden Gym, past the squash courts, in a dimly lit, surprisingly warm room.
