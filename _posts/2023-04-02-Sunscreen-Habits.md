PREFACE BEGIN.

I was strolling outside my dorm, when I heard a deep whacking sound. It was reminiscent of a woodpecker, if it was the size of a car. Intrigued, I followed the sound down the stairs and under the pedestrian bridge, where I now faced an unpaved dirt hill, blocked by trees. One step at a time, I shifted through the shrubbery where the view cleared up. There, three tennis courts away, was this girl aggressively pounding the ball on a frail, cracked wooden wall. I had never seen a wall being bullied before, but with each penetrating shot, the wooden wall croaked a desperate cry for help. Fear, shock, and awe ran through me. Exactly what a good hitting partner should make you feel. So, I mustered up the courage to ask her to play.

We played a quick groundstroke game, and her lack of mercy was transferred from the wall to me, where she promptly humbled me. And then we talked for a little. The contents of that conversation have since faded from my memory except for two facts: she liked Drake, specifically old Drake, and she was wearing a lot of sunscreen. Then I left the courts, delighted to have met Sunscreen Drake girl. 

Since then, I’ve gotten to know her better and see more than the lightskin Drake side of her. Thank God. Beyond Drake, her music taste leans towards classic hip-hop, making her one of the biggest Cali Rap listeners on Spotify. I’ve learned that she has switched between vegetarian and omnivorous diets as frequently in her life as an oyster switches gender. And I have witnessed with my own eyes, her to be the most competitive thumb war specimen on the planet. Sprawled on the floor, kicking and thrashing, she will violently twist her body to get the desired wrist angle of attack. Rolling back and forth on the floor, hands interlocked with her felt like I had been dealt the death penalty, and it was for some reason being expedited. It made me laugh to see how utterly despondent she looked with each loss, but it was almost sweeter to see her wear that bold triumphant face with each victory.

She was competitive, and she usually won. Despite that, she was my favorite hitting partner. As I usually warmed up, she would come rushing onto the court with her chunky Rafa sneakers, Nike duffel bag slung across her shoulder, and signature crimson red long sleeve in uniform: meaning she was out for blood. Everytime she stepped on the court, I knew she was ready to go. 

But of all these recollections I have, one image of her remains the most vivid in my head. It’s a selfie of her after we had just hit and warmed up our cores, and on her face is an unbelievable amount of sunscreen. This girl loved sunscreen. Claiming it was always going to “rubbed in,” her face was usually as white as a bunny. It didn’t matter if it was a sunny Los Angeles day, if the clouds menacingly brewed above, or if the only light source was the radiating stadium lights, there would be a white thick paint plastered across her face like a wet Da Vinci Fresco.

She loved a good banter with her friends and would often get teased for mimicking MIchael Jackson’s transformation each time she got ready to play tennis. But in response to these comments, she simply laughed. While it took me a while to understand her instinctive need for sunscreen, I did begin to better understand how serious her relationship to tennis was.

From my dorm window, I had the best view: the Getty Villa and Santa Monica Mountains in the background, sunsets that washed the sky in extravagant oranges and yellows, but most importantly, all six tennis courts and every person on them. Unfortunately for me, my roommates had a chronic issue of sleeping absurdly late, sometimes getting up past lunch hours and on rare occasions the dinner hours. Thus, I normally would wake up to a closed curtain, with no view, and get to work despite the gloomy lighting. 

One day, I had just started my work when I heard this low, repetitive thumping sound. It was short like a clap, but also deep and muffled like a book snapping shut. I looked up and down trying to gauge if someone was dancing above me or if my roommate was unconsciously kicking the wall in his sleep. It was neither. I pondered for a moment and then I realized. This was a sound I knew deep in my heart. How could I forget? I inched closer to the curtain, poked my head under, and peered through the glass window. There she was, hitting the living shit out of the ball as usual. 

The next day, I heard a similar sound, and there she was again. And again. Each time, I would wake up a little groggy, attempting to watch some week-old lectures when I would hear that familiar popping sound, and my heart would pick up. I raced over to see that familiar face down on the court, motivating me to continue on with my lectures with the same fiery determination.

Sometimes, I couldn’t resist my excitement and would forget about the two roommates in deep sleep behind me, shouting and waving to her from five stories above. Somedays her partner would leave a little earlier than expected, and she would ask me to help her finish the necessary amount of hitting to “feel right”. I would be halfway down the stairs at this point. 

Class, tennis, then meeting. Meeting, tennis, then blood donation. Blood donation, tennis, then final. She always found a way to make time for tennis. It was not something to be loosely slipped into her schedule like a bookmark but rather it was the core part of the schedule that she would plan her other events around.

But it wasn’t always for fun. There would be times when I would see her frustrated, screaming at herself in discontent. I would be cautious to call out her name because I didn’t want to distract her when she was trying so hard to find her rhythm. But regardless of how she was playing, she gritted her teeth and finished strong. The next day, she always came back a little better. Even if I didn’t always have the courage to shout to her, it always brought a smile to my face to see her play. It instilled me with inspiration to get back to work, refusing to let another moment be wasted.

I was recently watching UCLA women's tennis play Stanford, and something I noticed was the consistency in Connie Ma’s attitude. Losing the first set 1-6, she came back with a swift 6-2, 6-0. But whether the score was 1-5 or 5-0, it made little difference to Connie. If she made the same unforced error, she would toss up her racket in mild frustration, regardless of the score, knowing that she could do better.

Similarly, watching Alcaraz sweep through Indian wells, I noticed little change in his attitude between his 5-0 games and 1-4 games. Throughout the whole match, he had this look in his eyes that exclaimed to the world “I am going to raise my level, right here, right now.” At the level these players practice, it is no longer the act of practicing that is of concern but rather getting into their zone and maintaining that state. While the good players can will themselves to lock in, the great players find their way in, unconsciously. The good players think about doing it while the best just do. 

In the presence of adversity, character is revealed. And what is character if not the trust in yourself, the patience for what you can not control, and a foundation of solid, unbreakable habits.

Everyone has different burdens, yet it’s not the weight you carry but where you carry it. Watching Sunscreen Drake girl on the court instilled in me the will to find love in the grit and fall in love with the process. It is only with this mindset can habits be hardened into impregnable, twinkling diamonds. From where she goes from here, I am only excited to watch and cheer her on, every step of the way.

Mac Miller once said: 

“You see her shinin'?
	That’s my sunlight, bitch.”

#### **THINKING VS FEELING**		
			  
I recently read a book on habits, and one takeaway is that you should underestimate your willpower. This is not an insult to your mental fortitude but rather a guideline to accomplish your goals with the least amount of willpower necessary. No matter how stubborn you are or how bad you want something, desire is a feeling and feelings are fleeting. While it still is possible to brute force your goals, I implore you to think about how long these results will last and how many times you can replicate this process. Why not increase your margin of error and give yourself more room to breathe?

If you want to go on a diet, that is a desire, an emotion. You might try telling yourself that “you will not eat added sugar for the next month” and quite possibly do it. But is this the smartest approach? What happens when the month is over? If you did not accomplish your goal, do you still feel motivated to keep going? Even if you did complete the month, are you going to repeat the same challenge the next month and the next month? 

It is very possible to complete one simple challenge through willpower alone, but life doesn’t give you one challenge at a time. Beyond your daily tasks, stress is stacked onto your life in deadlines, bad interactions, and illness without your consent. The righteous goal of improving oneself only seems to move farther away, not an immediate concern. Think about willpower as a quantifiable value, more or less having a limit. As you introduce another class, lack of sleep, and other stress factors, your willpower and thoughts are divided into tackling the more immediate problems, and your resolve is now disjoint.

Even if you can scrape enough of the remaining willpower together to keep your promise of not eating sugar despite your exhaustion, anxiety, and lack of patience, you will be asking yourself “why am I doing this?” This doubt unconsciously grows beyond control, making conscious willpower not sustainable in the long run.

Imagine your resolve to be a mighty oak tree. As your life runs into complications beyond your control, the tree withers. As you start questioning whether your initial resolve was strong enough to persevere, the doubt grows sucking away the water and nutrients in the soil. And when you have to consciously choose each time to reject all nine soda options to dispense water, temptation comes swinging like an axe, ready to make you fold.

I am not saying that willpower is not important in accomplishing your goals. I am saying that willpower alone is not enough. No, rather it is the deliberate planning, accounting for lapses in willpower, and integrating habits into your permanent identity that makes habits executable and sustainable. 
<br />

#### **THE FOUR PILLARS**

Let me explain briefly how habits are formed. According to James Clear, there are four main pillars in each habit:

Cue: What triggers the action
Crave: The incentive to take action
Response: How easy the action is
Reward: The satisfaction you feel after such action
<br />

#### **TOOTH BRUSHING & THE LOW-KEY FACTOR**

Take brushing your teeth, which satisfies all four pillars.
It’s easy to remember to do, once after waking up and once before going to sleep. Cue. 
Your mouth feels dirty so you desire the foamy nature of toothpaste to help it feel clean. Crave. Brushing takes two minutes and a couple of easy wrist rotations. Response.
And once you’re done, you’re left with a minty, refreshed mouth. Reward.

But take this same habit less than a century ago when toothpaste was an unflavored, starchy combination of soap and chalk. Although the timing and ease of activity remained the same, the crave and reward were gone, almost negated by the fact that you were stuffing chalk into your mouth.

As a result, the low percentage of people who brushed their teeth—prior to the invention of flavored toothpaste—accurately reflected the missing crave and reward aspects in a habit. Proportionally to companies amending this issue by increasing flavor options and travel packing options, the number of toothbrushers skyrocketed in the mid 20th century becoming the integrated habit that goes unnoticeable in many peoples’ daily lives. 

This low-key factor is the key to successful habits: you don’t think about when and how you are going to brush your teeth, because you don’t need to. At some point on your diet journey, the food you eat is no longer a stressful decision, but just the normal food you eat. 

I must emphasize you pay particular attention to this nuanced mindset. When you desire to start implementing habits, try to consider the long-term identity shift and not just the action. You don’t skip soda because you are eating healthy this month, you skip soda because you are a healthy person (identity). Similarly, a healthy person also exercises everyday, implements a balanced diet, and understands the importance of recovery as well. Target your identity first, then extrapolate actions from there.
<br />

#### **LAND ON THE MOON**

How can you apply this to starting habits? Well, not every habit you desire will be as easy as brushing your teeth, but you can make it as easy if not easier to begin with. Aspiring to become a writer may seem daunting, and when you promise yourself to start writing everyday, it may feel impossible to accomplish. Taking into account your hectic schedule and the possibilities of emergencies, let’s simplify the action of writing to its very core and start with writing one sentence a day. This is not only doable but now repeatable. Even on your worst day of work, harassed by angry customers and your boss, barely able to scrounge together enough energy and ingredients to make what resembles to be a meal, one sentence seems manageable. When starting a habit, it’s about completing the action with confidence not only on your best days but your worst days too. If you had immediately assigned yourself to write short novella drafts everyday, on your worst day, that would feel unmanageable. Plan to land on the moon if you can’t make it to the stars.

The reason why you start so easy is because that first sentence, that first step, is always the hardest part about making a habit. It requires a jumpstart of willpower and careful planning around your personal limits for repeatability. To be able to simply write one sentence a day, consistently, enables confidence and an unconscious cycle of writing each day. When you realize you have a little more energy in the tank, your own curiosity drives you to write that next sentence and the next. So the habit evolves naturally: from a sentence into a paragraph, a paragraph into a page, and a page into stories. A habit is solidified when it happens unconsciously, and the key to long term progression starts with small repeatable steps.
<br />

#### **MANIPULATING TEMPTATION**

As I am writing this, I am fasting for Ramadan: meaning no food or water during the day. This seemingly arduous task can be made much easier or more difficult depending on the planning. I had left a water bottle right next to my computer from last night, and as I continued writing, I noticed that I began eyeing the bottle when I felt a little thirsty, yet I ignored it and carried on. A few paragraphs later, and I’m getting frustrated and running out of ideas. The slight exhaustion from waking up early was getting to me. So, I stuck my hand out. My brain shut off and suddenly my mouth was filled with water and emergency sirens began ringing in my head.

“JERRY DO NOT SWALLOW RIGHT NOW”. 

I stumbled out of my chair, rushing to the bathroom, promptly spitting out my water. I had almost broken my fast on accident, and it was due to the alluring trap I had coincidentally set for myself. Plan accounting for lapses in willpower not ignoring them.

If you don’t want to drink water, don’t leave water bottles within an arm’s distance. If you don’t want to be tempted, try to the best of your ability to remove such temptations. And if you want to be the one introducing a new habit, figure out the most cunning way to tempt yourself into the action you desire. Make the action convenient for you and take advantage of your mind’s vulnerability. Bring a foam roller to the tennis court if you want to remember to cool down and stretch after. Put a water bottle next to your bed, if you want to drink water before going to sleep. Habits work better when linked together.
<br />

#### **SUNSCREEN HABITS**

Let’s take a look at a habit that is not as easy as brushing your teeth. Something that is neutral if not  failing in all the four pillars: putting on sunscreen. 

	Action: Putting on Sunscreen
Cue: Before going outside and every subsequent 2 hours
Crave: Avoid sunburns and skin cancer at age 50
Response: Difficult, hard-to-reach spots on body
Reward: Slimy hands, oily face, drips into your eyes

It fails in regard to almost every aspect of the pillars. Without the recent surge in promoting dermatology health in advertisement and pediatrician consulting, sunscreen would not be nearly as accepted as it is. However, still upwards of 45% of men and 27% of women never use sunscreen. 

If you are reading this and thinking to yourself, “putting on sunscreen is not that hard”, that’s because you have done it already. You have made something, intrinsically not appealing, into a habit. You don’t put on sunscreen because someone tells you to, you do it because it is a part of who you are. Now as you approach new habits such as diets, getting into painting, and reminding yourself to put your keys back, remember the four pillars and try to plan diligently so you suffer less. New things seem daunting to embrace, but against the odds, you made putting on sunscreen, a slimy, sticky substance that burns your eyes, an unconscious habit and you can do it again.

Arthur Ashe once said that “True Heroism is remarkably sober.” And I believe greatness, similarly, is not the result of a flash of willpower but rather the slow, flowing, mundaneness of sunscreen habits.
