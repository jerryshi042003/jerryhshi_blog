"It's Too Late" - Carole King
I was sitting on the NY subway. 7 train towards Flushing. On my way to the US Open. The train was packed, everyone in a rush to get to work in the morning. My face was buried deep into the kindle in my lap, paying little attention to those around me. This old lady carrying a guitar walks into the subway. She is wearing a long pink dress, with scarves draped around her body, and a headband holding her hair together. She starts singing and playing the guitar beautifully. I immediately look up. I can't understand the lyrics she's singing but the melody is beautiful. She starts to walk towards me, I put my head down in my kindle because I have no cash to give her. She walks away. I look up. I hear bits of the lyrics. "It's too late. It's too late." She sings somberly. "Something inside has died." It's beautiful, I can't stop listening. But I arrived at my stop, Mets-Wilet Point. I have to go. I scramble to put my kindle in my bag. I hurridly type in the lyrics I remember into my phone. "It's Too Late" by Carole King pops up. As I walk across the wooden bridge past the train station, past the Mets Citi Field, I listen to this beautiful song, that I discovered because of the lady in the subway.
